Check wiki for the rule set and game plan.
Master branche is for a tested build. Everything must be working.
Test branche is were we test the build.
Develop branche is were we are going to push changes to the project.Only working features.


From the Develop brache there will be diferent branches for files ,classes ect.Onces something is ready and working we will push it to Develop brache.Than as we get a working build and it's ready for testing as a hole we will push it to Test branche and if it is working like it shoud -> master branche.
